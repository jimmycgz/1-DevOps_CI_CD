// # Should run this script at Admin Tool Server which has both Jenkins and AWS CLI (plus S3) installed & configured. 

 //Follow below steps to resolve issue : Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure ".
 // Need to install Plugin Pipeline: AWS Steps   
 //Step0: Read this guide https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/automation-jenkins.html
//Step1: In AWS IAM, Create a user account for the Jenkins server , like Jenkins-aws, record the Key ID and Sec Key.
//Stpe2: In SHELL of Jenkins server, change to jenkins user and run: sudo su ï¿½ jenkins  ; aws configure - profile Jenkins-aws // input the key recorded from AWS IAM, associate this profile Jenkins-aws to Linux user jenkins
//Step3: exit jenkins and sudo su to root or switch to ubuntu ;  chmod 640 for the two files config and credentials in /var/lib/jenkins/.aws
//Step4: test if the these two accounts get associated: sudo su -jenkins; aws s3api list-buckets --query "Buckets[].Name" --profile Jenkins-aws  
//Step5: Add 3 Environment variables aws_access_key_id AWS_DEFAULT_REGION aws_secret_access_key with related key values   DONE setup!!!

//Clarification about the users being used by Jenkins, Linux and AWS:
// Jenkins application has a customized login ID like jmykinekins associated with a Nick Name like Jmy,  should be defined right after the first time logging in after installation.
// In Linux, Jenkins service user is jenkins , fixed, use command sudo service jenkins status to check service status , we can switch to this user via sudo su - jenkins, we can't sudo su Jenkins-aws the user we created in AWS IAM . 
// AWS CLI can use multiple profiles, normally the profile data is stored at $HOME/.AWS, these profile users can be used by any users of Linux userGroup by presetup in it's own CLI : AWS configure -- profile profile_name (here it's Jenkins-aws)
// The Jenkins-aws user we created from AWS IAM is one of the profiles that AWS can use. It can be used by the jenkins which pre-configured via jenkins Linux account in AWS CLI, or it can be used by ubuntu user if you config it at ubuntu CLI.
